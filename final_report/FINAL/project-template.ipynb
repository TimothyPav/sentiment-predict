    "A discussion of the modeling assumptions made in the problem (e.g., is it from physics? economics? something else?). Explain the decision variables, the constraints, and the objective function, both in words and in math. Discuss the model type (LP, QP, MIP, etc.). \n",
    "For this section you should **assume the reader is familiar with the material covered in class**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equations should be formatted in $\\LaTeX$ within the IJulia notebook. The internet is full of resources on how to use $\\LaTeX$!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of an equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Ax=b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the equation is short, you can also write it inline $Ax=b$. This also works for explaining the different symbols. For example, for the previous equation, you would want to include the following explanation: We consider the equation $Ax=b$, where $A$ is a matrix, $x$ is a vector of variables, and $b$ is the right hand side vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how you can write a matrix:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "  1 & 2 \\\\\n",
    "  3 & 4\n",

    "\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix} =\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 6 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And here is an example of how to typically write an optimization problem. Notice the use of the \"aligned\" environment, which aligns subsequent equations at the position of the \\& signs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",

    "& x_i \\leq 0.3 \\quad \\text{for all} \\quad i = 1, \\dots, n, \\\\\n",
    "& x_i \\geq 0 \\quad \\text{for all} \\quad i = 1, \\dots, n\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "  - $x_i$ represents the allocation to the $i$-th stock in the portfolio.\n",
    "  - $\\mathbf{E}$ is the vector of expected returns for each stock, i.e., $\\mu_{NS}$ from the code.\n",
    "  - The objective function is to maximize the expected return of the portfolio, $\\mathbf{E}^T x$, which is the dot product of the expected return vector and the allocation vector.\n",
    "  - The first constraint ensures that the sum of the allocations is 1, meaning the portfolio is fully invested.\n",
    "  - The second constraint limits the maximum allocation to any single stock to 30\\% (i.e., $x_i \\leq 0.3$).\n",
    "  - The third constraint ensures that the allocations are non-negative (i.e., $x_i \\geq 0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the code incorporates a risk term related to the portfolio's variance or covariance matrix $\\sigma$, where the risk is penalized in the objective function. This can be incorporated as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Objective:} \\quad \\mathbf{E}^T x - \\lambda x^T \\sigma x \\\\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "  - $\\sigma$ is the covariance matrix of stock returns.\n",
    "  - $\\lambda$ is the risk aversion parameter (set to 0.5 in the code). The term $\\lambda x^T \\sigma x$ penalizes the variance of the portfolio, thus balancing between maximizing return and minimizing risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "However this all constitutes how a normal trade optimizer works, our \"sentiment-adjusted\" trade optimizer adds a new variable into the mix\n"

    "Here, you should code up your model in Julia + JuMP and solve it. Your code should be clean, easy to read, well annotated and commented, and it should compile! You are not allowed to use other programming languages or DCP packages such as `convex.jl`. **We will be running your code, and you want to make sure that everything works if we run the code blocks in sequence**. Having multiple code blocks separated by text blocks (either as separate cells or blocks of comments) that explain the various parts of your solution will make it much easier for us to understand your project. \n",
    "\n",
    "We would also like to see that you make several variants or run different kinds of analysis for your problem (e.g., by changing the input parameters, the constraints or objective, or deriving a dual problem). We expect at least 1-2 such problem variants as part of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember that if you do not write your description of the project and comment your code well, we cannot understand what you have done. Even if it is technically brilliant, you will lose points if you do not write well and comment your code well.**\n",
    "It's fine to call solvers and external packages we have used in the course such as `Gurobi` or `Plots`, but try to minimize the use of other packages. We want to be able to understand what is happening in your code without looking up additional references. "
